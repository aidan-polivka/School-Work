#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ CAPSTONE PROJECT ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~#

 This is a folder containing the full android application I created for my senior project.
 The important files are hard to find if you've never used android studio, so I've included
 file paths in this ReadMe so viewers do not have to search for them.

# SUMMARY

This is an android application used to turn an image imported from the user's gallery into
music. It is not a complete project, there are ways I would like to change it, however the
function of the application is complete. I would like to increase the library of notes, and
change the algorithm that chooses which notes are picked in each chord so that it is more
accurate in terms of music theory. I would also like to update the user interface in the 
future. This application displays understanding of image processing and sound processing.
